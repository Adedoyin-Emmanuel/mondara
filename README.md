# Playing with Fimidara 🎖️

You get the joke. In this repo, I will be playing with Fimidara. Basically the SDK though, I will be doing major stuff and I will use this README as my notetaker. <https://fimidara.com> Fimidara is an open source file storage for software engineers. Built by Abayomi Akintomide. I call him Yomi btw.
